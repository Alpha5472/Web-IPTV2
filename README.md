You can fork the repository, edit your .m3u playlist and after enabling github-pages. you are good to go.

For Android/Smart TVs: Go to github playlist, copy raw file url(i.e. just add ' ?raw=true ' in the end of browser url) and paste it in IPTV Player.

This is IPTV Concept made by me.
Some channels may not work due to CORS policy.

# Problem Statement:

IPTV is a new method of delivering and viewing television programs using an IP network and high speed broadband technology. It is fast becoming a popular value added service in many countries. 
However in India, IPTV is yet to be a big thing.

As per TRAI Regulations,
New Delhi, 4th January, 2008 â€“ Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) releases the recommendation on provisioning of IPTV services. 

IPTV is legal in India but it not yet provisioned by government.

So, I am making a concept of IPTV service.
Collecting some .m3u sources of free 2 air TV Channels.
Creating a basic Bootstrap based Web page that handles the URLs from the .m3u8 Playlist And Chromecast based addon player to play those livestreams in browser.
